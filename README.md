# Android-IntelSMS-Framework
IntelSMS embedded server intended to be accessed by the IntelSMS Desktop version.

This is the really basic foundation code for havind an Android device receiving commands from a remote Windows device and reply to them.
This is C# code for the client part (Windows), that will be found in the .cs files (most important functions).
This is Java for the server part (Android), that will be found in files under /app folder.

This MUST be improved and secured.

This can be a good starting point for programming a server application that communicates with a remote android device.

Note that the server is the Android device, and the client is the Windows application.
That should be inverted I think.
